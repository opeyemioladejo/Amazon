        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p id="para1">Amazon is guided by four principles: 
        customer obsession rather than competitor focus, 
        passion for invention, commitment to operational 
        excellence, and long-term thinking. Amazon 
        strives to be Earth’s most customer-centric 
        company, Earth’s best employer, and Earth’s 
        safest place to work. Customer reviews, 
        1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations, 
        Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct 
        Publishing, Kindle, Career Choice, Fire TV, 
        Amazon Echo, Alexa, Just Walk Out technology, 
        and The Climate Pledge are some of the things 
        pioneered by Amazon.</p>
        <p id="para2">Amazon’s “Day 1” mentality is our approach of doing 
        everything with the energy and entrepreneurial spirit 
        of a new organization on its first day.</p>
        <p id="para3">Working to earn and keep our customers’ trust is the 
        single biggest driver of Amazon’s Day 1 approach. 
        Amazon’s decision-making process that asks employees 
        to consider whether an action is a one-way 
        door—consequential and nearly irreversible—or a two-way 
        door, easy to change course and go back. Discover more 
        about who we are through our Annual Letters to 
        Shareholders from 1997 through today.</p>
